# FreeCAD Color Alterator
user.cfg color alterations made easy.

This macro presents you with a window with all the colors found in user.cfg and clicking on the color (in the color column) pops up a color dialog letting you select a different color. 
It should work with any FreeCAD installation of v0.19 or higher, please report an issue if it doesn't.

## Installation
Please see the FreeCAD wiki on how to install a macro

## License
FreeCAD wants the license for a macro in a specific format so I've put it as 
* CC0-1.0 (Basically public domain, see https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
* Github allows selecting a license and I didn't find CC0-1.0 so I went with the unlicense which is bascically the same thing

Realistically  all you need to know is that is work done for the 'greater good'. I'm not here to make a profit and you can do whatever you want with the code :)
